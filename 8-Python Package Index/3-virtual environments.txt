if we want to have an isolated environment for each project
with different versions of packgaes and so on we could use
virtual environmets in python as we could use conda environments with conda (almost the same concept but different tooling)

execute this:

python -m venv NAME_OF_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_DIRECTORY

(or with python3)

activate the venv:

source NAME_OF_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_DIRECTORY/bin/activate

then you can install anything in this environment

deactivate the venv:

deactivate


see also the general use cases of python -m:

but all in all it's used to run python modules in command line
